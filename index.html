                    <p>“We push each other to be the best. It’s not 
                    uncommon for one of us to say ‘this needs 
                    to be better, back to the drawing board’”</p>

                <p>The Bees Knees</p>
                    <p>The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating 
                        from San Francisco, California. The band 
                        consists of lead vocalist Bryan Teddy, guitarist 
                        Mack Tolkens, guitarist Andrew Green, bassist 
                        Kent Zulkee and drummer Freddie Fischer. The 
                        band achieved its first commercial success as 
                        an unsigned act, drawing attention from 
                        manager Cam Adams. Having worked with 
                        other popular acts (The Elephant In The Room, 
                        One Trick Pony, The Cat’s Meow), Adams was 
                        confident the band could succeed even further, 
                        pushing them to sign with Magenta Records. </p>
                    <p>From there, the band has soared, gaining 
                        international recognition and ranking in the 
                        top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans 
                        immediately fell in love with the band’s original 
                        and organic attitude, solidifying their place as 
                        one of the hottest and fastest up and coming 
                        acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to 
                        themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to 
                        their candid and authentic performances on 
                        stage. Looking forward to touring in the future, 
                        The Bees Knees are currently recording their 
                        second studio album, looking to be released in 
                        late 2021.</p>
